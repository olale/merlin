Dependencies:

	* Ruby (& Rake). Download Ruby 1.9.3 from
	  http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and check "Add Ruby
	  executables to your PATH" during installation.

	  Note: An issue with Bundler/Rubygems and a SSL Certificate,
	  along with limited gem support for Ruby 2.0 (specifically,
	  the lack of precompiled native mingw libraries for gems
	  "tiny_tds" & "gtk 1.1.5") restricts us from using Ruby 2.0 as of
	  2013-04.

	  See:

	  - https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds/issues/110 (Tiny TDS for Ruby 2.0)

	  - http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/4412070 (Gtk gem supports
            Ruby 2 in version 1.2.3, but we must use Gtk 1.1.5 until
            segfaults on Windows are resolved, see
            http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/4410886#1097160)

	* The Ruby Gem 'bundler': run "gem install bundler" 

	* All other Ruby gems managed by bundle: run "bundle install" from
          the folder of this file (INSTALL.txt).

	* For development, if using Emacs: 

	    * Download from http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/

	    * Add the contents of the "emacs" directory to your
	      local $HOME folder (typically
	      "C:/Users/${USER}/AppData/Roaming/")

	    * Assuming you unpacked Emacs in ${EMACS_HOME}, run
	    ${EMACS_HOME}/bin/addpm.exe to get links in the start
	    menu.

	    * Associate .rb files with ${EMACS_HOME}/bin/runemacs.exe

	* Team Foundation Power Tools is required for the
	  "tfs:uu" and "tfs:tc:uu" tasks. TFPT and other
	  commands is auto-detected if installed at
	  C:/Program*/Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010 Power
	  Tools/TFPT.exe

	* For IRb enhancements such as completion, copy dotfiles/.irbrc to $HOME

Configuration:

	* copy the config/{logging,environment}.yml.sample to
	  config/{logging,environment}.yml and modify your settings
	  as appropriate.  The copied config/{logging,environment}.yml
	  files are personal and should not be added to version
	  control.

	* run "rake test:config" to find out if your settings in
          config/*.yml are correct

	* Change your ${HOME}/.emacs file with the correct path to
	  tfs/tf-exe to perform TFS tasks from within Emacs (see
	  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/tfs.el).
